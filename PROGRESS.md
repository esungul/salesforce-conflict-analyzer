## 🚀 Session 1: Project Setup & Architecture Decision

### Time: ~1 hour

**Initial Plan:**
- Started with JavaScript/TypeScript + React + Node.js approach
- Encountered setup issues (Git configuration, Node.js tooling)
- Spent too much time on tooling vs solving actual problem

**Pivot Decision:**
Made strategic decision to switch to Python backend:
- **Reason**: Faster development for data processing
- **Benefit**: Pandas library makes CSV parsing trivial
- **Trade-off**: Will need separate backend deployment
- **Result**: Correct decision - built working tool in hours instead of days

**Key Learning:**
> Choose technology based on the problem, not trends. Python + Pandas was perfect for CSV data analysis.
